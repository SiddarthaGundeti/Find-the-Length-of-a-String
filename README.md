Tutorial: Find the Length of a String
Let's learn how to write a Python program to find the length of a string step by step.

Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to write a program that reads a word and prints the length of the word. The length of a string is the number of characters in the string.

Step 2: Get the word from the user
First, let's ask the user to enter a word. We'll use the input() function to get the value.
Now we have the word as a string.

Step 3: Find the length of the word
We can find the length of the word using the len() function in Python.
This will give us the length of the word as an integer.

Step 4: Print the result
Finally, we'll print the length of the word using the print() function.
